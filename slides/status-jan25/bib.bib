  abstract = {In this paper, we propose an approach for constructing a multi-layer multi-orbit space information network (SIN) to provide high-speed continuous broadband connectivity for space missions (nanosatellite terminals) from the emerging space-based Internet providers. This notion has been motivated by the rapid developments in satellite technologies in terms of satellite miniaturization and reusable rocket launch, as well as the increased number of nanosatellite constellations in lower orbits for space downstream applications, such as earth observation, remote sensing, and Internet of Things (IoT) data collection. Specifically, space-based Internet providers, such as Starlink, OneWeb, and SES O3b, can be utilized for broadband connectivity directly to/from the nanosatellites, which allows a larger degree of connectivity in space network topologies. Besides, this kind of establishment is more economically efficient and eliminates the need for an excessive number of ground stations while achieving real-time and reliable space communications. This objective necessitates developing suitable radio access schemes and efficient scalable space backhauling using inter-satellite links (ISLs) and inter-orbit links (IOLs). Particularly, service-oriented radio access methods in addition to software-defined networking (SDN)-based architecture employing optimal routing mechanisms over multiple ISLs and IOLs are the most essential enablers for this novel concept. Thus, developing this symbiotic interaction between versatile satellite nodes across different orbits will lead to a breakthrough in the way that future downstream space missions and satellite networks are designed and operated.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a framework for integrating Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) platforms with Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) in the emerging 6G communication landscape. Our work applies the Mega-Constellation Services in Space (MCSS) paradigm, leveraging LEO mega-constellations’ expansive coverage and capacity, designed initially for terrestrial devices, to serve platforms in lower LEO orbits. Results show that this approach overcomes the limitation of sporadic and time-bound satellite communication links, a challenge not fully resolved by available Ground Station Networks and Data Relay Systems.We contribute three key elements: (i) a detailed MCSS evaluation framework employing Monte Carlo simulations to assess space user links and distributions; (ii) a novel Space User Terminal (SUT) design optimized for MCSS, using different configurations and 5G New Radio Adaptive Coding and Modulation; (iii) extensive results demonstrating MCSS’s substantial improvement over existing Ground Station Networks and Data Relay Systems, motivating its role in the upcoming 6G NTNs. The space terminal, incorporating a multi-system, multi-orbit, and software-defined architecture, can handle Terabit-scale daily data volumes and minute-scale latencies. It offers a compact, power-efficient solution for properly integrating LEO platforms as space internet nodes.},
