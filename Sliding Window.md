- [ ] Requires propablity optimization
- [ ] Solution should be re-evaluated for each $T_W$ sliding across $T_{max}$ 
	- [ ] Re-evaluation should use efficient _rerun_ of bellman ford 
	- [ ] Update distribution of current NS 
	- [ ] Set future nodes of current NS weight to inf
	- [ ] keep other nodes same weight as before
	- [ ] Maybe think about better optimizations ?
- [ ] Instead
