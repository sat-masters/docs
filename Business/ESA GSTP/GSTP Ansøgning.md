#### Outline the technology this activity addresses including the technical work to be under- taken. Briefly indicate the implementation schedule and requested budget.

The development of this product should start with a focus on the Earth observation satellites. 
The use of DTN protocols stemms from the fact that the connection is intermitten.. 
Our proposal is to use existing infrastructure to minimize the disruptions (both in amount and time). 
To make a true "space internet " we can connect satellites to LEO infrastruture. 


* Intro which takes udgangspunkt in what they ask
	* Creating a solar system internet starts by connecting Earth satellites

* Why our solution is relevant to this activity 

* What is our solution more technically

* Implementation schedule 
	* phase 1, 8 months
	* The activity states 8 moths is this realistic? 
		* Talk with someone. 
		* Can we ask for more?

* Requested budget.
* Justify the budget. (lav budgettet)


#### Why is the development of this technology a priority to you company/organization? How will you develop this opportunity during and after the activity? What happens next (please include a timeline)?

* Purpose of our company is to develop this technology 
* What have we observed with the current way of doing it. 

* Collaboration between the European mega constellations. 
* Collaboration with Danish satellite building companies. 

* We see this product being the de-facto downlink solution for small to medium sized satellites In the coming years.
#### Detail the strategic, economic, social, etc. benefit this activity has to you company?

* We are starting our company.
* This is our core technology. 
* This funding would accelerate the development of a technology we see as a essential part of the industry in the coming years. 
* (Would enable us to better compete against established companies)
* We will develop the technology anyways. 

#### Describe the financial commitment required for this activity. Include a breakdown by company/organization, showing member state, work packages etc. where appropriate.

* List of milestones that need to be reached
	* Who is responsible for each milestone
	* What is the "cost" of each milestone
* Are there any financial commitment from the companies "own pockets"?
* All companies in DK?
