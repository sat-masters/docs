- Integration with DTN protocols?
	- Just brief mention that DTN can be build on top of our solution.
- 
- Analysis deliverables. 
	- Performance of Legacy vs. new system on key metrics
	- Antenna design ITR vs. isotropic 
	- RF band pollution analysis
	- Performance analysis of DTN vs no DTN protocols
		- Performance with transport layer.  
- Simulation environment for multiple constellations, users and groundstations. 
	- Collaboration? Watch for IPR
	- Our self?
	- Watch out for Licenses

- Selection algorithm 
	- In high level language for demonstration
	- in compiled language which can run on embedded systems
	- What is input / output for this block?
- Choice of random access protocol
	- Maybe custom?
- Define system statemachine.
- Integration of system block and simulation environment.
- Simulation of multiple satellites using multiple constellations as cohesive network. 
- Hardware in the loop?

#### Project duration
