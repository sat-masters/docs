## Starlink plug and plaser
Starlink plug and plaser hooks into the ISLs of the Starlink network and transfers high amount of data.

Tracking and Data Relay system. 
Continous covarage as this is GEO but lower capacity.

#### Arguments for

#### Arguments against
The price of building out new ground stations. 
Still not able to get down to the latencies we are talking about
Is essentially the same as just using AWS/KSAT
