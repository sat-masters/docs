# Agenda:

-  We propose the link establishment 

# Notes:

- Use cases 
	- Earth observation 
		- Spacial requirement 
		- latency requirement 
		- 
- Network management 
	- Ad hoc connection 
	- Constant connection 
	- We move faster than expected how does this affect handover 
		- Conditional handover
	- How to choose the right satellite to connect up to 
		- Choose the closest to destination or best connected satellite. 
		- 
		- Dependent on the data you want to send 
		- Dependent over which part of earth you are. 
		- Minimum time for a connection to be considered.
		- Connection establishment time from 3GPPP
	- Ask for QoS
- Traffic communication pattern 
	- Random: ALOHA 
	- Latency: At random point how much latency will there be. to coverage-> to delivery 
	- Coverage: Israel has a figure on a paper. 
	- 
- Performance
Price: choose oneweb or Starlink 
- What orbit to get into to get best coverage. It has to adapt
