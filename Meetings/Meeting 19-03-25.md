# Agenda:
Our problems right now
- Variance 
	- The variance of the probabilities is basically very low, and therefore it does not matter what satellite we choose as they are are all 
- Using distributions we have to have some sort of demands to optimize for 
- Joint distributions 
	- Is this a thing and does it make sense?
