# Agenda:
What we have been working on: 
- Using network calculus to create arrival, departure, service curves and backlog curves. 
1. Tried to minimize the probability of overflow in the buffer. 
2. Backlog length 
3. Time in the backlog
- The last two are not probabilities
- 

Our problems right now
- Variance 
	- The variance of the probabilities is basically very low, and therefore it does not matter what satellite we choose as they are are all either 0% chance or 100% chance. 
	- Maybe use probabilistic arrivals (H265) 
- Using distributions we have to have some sort of demands to optimize for 
- Joint distributions 
	- Is this a thing and does it make sense? 

Monte Carlo is that a good idea?
Meetings more often/ regularly?
