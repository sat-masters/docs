# Agenda:

- Optimization problem with added the utilization for the satellites. 

# Notes:

- Use 5g to compare how it's done in regards to getting resourcs.
- Ask/take for resources 
- Contextual bandits 
	- Non model specific 
- Alternatively estimate the distribustions and then choose. 
- miguel angel vazques predictability of internet traffic
- Find the optimal on average vs. find the optimal for right now. 
- How to model the utilization. 
- video streaming for requirements. 
- Maximizing the flow/minimizing the probability of error. 
- devide it into slots of 10 seconds which are independent. 

### After thoughts: 
- Devide the earth into cells and give each cell a distribution/mean
- A way of solving the optimization problem. 
- Defining the ojective function in python
- Look into evaluation metrics + defining how the simulation should be done 
- UE application table (and what this means for the traffic demands of the satellite)
- 
- Far future work 
	- Adding sampling from the satellites
