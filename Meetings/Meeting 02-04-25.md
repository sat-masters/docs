# Agenda:
Miscelaneous things:
- Exam date
- Business meeting date
System model
Should we focus on optimizing the solution we have now or just say "We get a bigger computer"
	- Who should we talk to to get some compute?
	- 

# Notes:
1. flying devince 
	1. generating data
2. Relay for ground device 
	1. Generated on earth 
3. Increase coverage to other satellites 

Just say we focus on one of the above (flying device)

Probability of getting rate larger than rate R
Graph 


What do we need to attatch these things to the network is the next thing. 

Compute: 
	Numba vectorization
	Things that can run in parallel
	Pipeline 

Introduction 
Motivation
A short easy to understand overview algorithm 

What we need before business meeting
	what is your product: 
		Is the guidance the satellite 
		The communication system 
	Customer: GOMspace 

	Application areas: 

Attachment 

IRIS2 is going 5G 

Shell around 5G 

	Who is the stupid competitor. 

Sell the interface. 

 

	Find the selling points. 
		lower latency
		Focus on the data storage capacity on satellites. 

	Key IPR
		Taking existing interface and put our on top. 

Find competitors 

Figure out the level of maturity we have to present
