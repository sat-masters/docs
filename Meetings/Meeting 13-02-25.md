# Agenda:
Presentation follow up
- Shortest path 
	- Dijkstra
	- Bellman-ford
	- Longest path (sp with neg weights)
- Jimmy crossings
	- Reduce  
Prepare the following visuals
- Temporal lattice graph
	- Longest path solution
	- Weights (Point estimate vs Distribution )
* Reduced graphs
	* Ideas for graph building techniques
* Antenna gain model
	* plots her
* Numerical vs Analytical
	* parametrize orbits -> gain function
	* Computational complexity in or out of scope
