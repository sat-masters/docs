# Agenda:
Presentation follow up
- Shortest path 
	- Dijkstra
	- Bellman-ford
	- Longest path (sp with neg weights)
- Jimmy crossings
	- Reduce search space of allocation changing times
	- Reduce what sats can be changed from -> to

Worked on:
- Temporal lattice graph
	- Longest path solution
	- Weights (Point estimate vs Distribution )
* Reduced graphs
	* Ideas for graph building techniques
	* throughput ranking 
	* slope ranking
* Antenna gain model
	* plots her
* Numerical vs Analytical
	* parametrize orbits -> gain function
	* Computational complexity in or out of scope
