Analog and Mixed Digital processors, aiming to replicate neurons. 
Computations are approximate as its actually analog signals being used for arithmetic.
Usually used for ML, AI as an alternative to GPUs.

A study uses this for onboard beamforming, but maybe it could be used for channel decoding as well?
