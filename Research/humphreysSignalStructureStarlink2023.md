>We develop a technique for blind signal identification of the Starlink downlink signal in the 10.7 to 12.7 GHz band and present a detailed picture of the signalâ€™s structure. Importantly, the signal characterization offered herein includes the exact values of synchronization sequences embedded in the signal that can be exploited to produce pseudorange measurements. Such an understanding of the signal is essential to emerging efforts that seek to dual-purpose Starlink signals for positioning, navigation, and timing, despite their being designed solely for broadband Internet provision.

- <mark class="hltr-green">"Instead, a more comprehensive Doppler model is required, consisting of both a frequency shift and compression/dilation of the baseband signal."</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5655478/items/5WD6KVPU?page=3&annotation=L2EQVLRP)
	 - #doppler
	 - This might be important to us as well. After this quote the reason to extend the doppler model can be found.
