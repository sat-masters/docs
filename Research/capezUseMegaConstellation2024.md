- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"The exploration of leveraging LEO mega-constellation linksfor communication began with H. Al-Hraishawi et al. in 2021 [26], where multi-layer space information networks were considered. This concept was further expanded upon by G.Maiolini Capez et al. in 2023 with a detailed characterizationof the Mega-Constellation links for LEO Missions [27]. Inthe same year, H. Chougrani et al. contributed a feasibility study, emphasizing the significant potential of MCSS [28]."</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5655478/items/IH34KBC6?page=4&annotation=HRQ332RF)<br>

- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Insteadof delineating specific antenna beams, a satellite’s visibility isdetermined solely based on the off-Zenith angle, providingterminal designers with the flexibility to optimize antennadesign within the bounds of a viable minimum elevationangle. This approach simplifies the design process, although aspecific radiation pattern mask can be applied if detailed beamcharacterization is necessary"</mark> [Page 8](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5655478/items/IH34KBC6?page=8&annotation=ASNZ2A2Z)<br>
  
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"For the purposes outlined in this paper,we have chosen to fix the user bandwidth and focus on opti-mizing the Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) selection."</mark> [Page 9](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5655478/items/IH34KBC6?page=9&annotation=XY7C98X5)<br>
