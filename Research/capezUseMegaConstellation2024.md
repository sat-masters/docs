| Abstract | This paper presents a framework for integrating Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) platforms with Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) in the emerging 6G communication landscape. Our work applies the Mega-Constellation Services in Space (MCSS) paradigm, leveraging LEO mega-constellations’ expansive coverage and capacity, designed initially for terrestrial devices, to serve platforms in lower LEO orbits. Results show that this approach overcomes the limitation of sporadic and time-bound satellite communication links, a challenge not fully resolved by available Ground Station Networks and Data Relay Systems.We contribute three key elements: (i) a detailed MCSS evaluation framework employing Monte Carlo simulations to assess space user links and distributions; (ii) a novel Space User Terminal (SUT) design optimized for MCSS, using different configurations and 5G New Radio Adaptive Coding and Modulation; (iii) extensive results demonstrating MCSS’s substantial improvement over existing Ground Station Networks and Data Relay Systems, motivating its role in the upcoming 6G NTNs. The space terminal, incorporating a multi-system, multi-orbit, and software-defined architecture, can handle Terabit-scale daily data volumes and minute-scale latencies. It offers a compact, power-efficient solution for properly integrating LEO platforms as space internet nodes.                   |

- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"The exploration of leveraging LEO mega-constellation linksfor communication began with H. Al-Hraishawi et al. in 2021 [26], where multi-layer space information networks were considered. This concept was further expanded upon by G.Maiolini Capez et al. in 2023 with a detailed characterizationof the Mega-Constellation links for LEO Missions [27]. Inthe same year, H. Chougrani et al. contributed a feasibility study, emphasizing the significant potential of MCSS [28]."</mark> [Page 4](zotero://open-pdf/groups/5655478/items/IH34KBC6?page=4&annotation=HRQ332RF)

- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Insteadof delineating specific antenna beams, a satellite’s visibility isdetermined solely based on the off-Zenith angle, providingterminal designers with the flexibility to optimize antennadesign within the bounds of a viable minimum elevationangle.
