- <mark class="hltr-#ffd400">"The exploration of leveraging LEO mega-constellation linksfor communication began with H. Al-Hraishawi et al. in 2021 [26], where multi-layer space information networks were considered. This concept was further expanded upon by G.Maiolini Capez et al. in 2023 with a detailed characterizationof the Mega-Constellation links for LEO Missions [27]. Inthe same year, H. Chougrani et al. contributed a feasibility study, emphasizing the significant potential of MCSS [28]."</mark> Page 4
- <mark class="hltr-#ffd400">"FCC filings related to Earth Stations (termi-nals, gateways) and Space Stations (satellites) of specific satel-lite operators [38], [39]"</mark> Page 5- The cited filings could be interesting to read
- <mark class="hltr-#ffd400">"Our previous study in [27] thoroughly ana-lyzed the Doppler effect within the MCSS framework"</mark> Page 6

- <mark class="hltr-#ffd400">"we apply a 20% reductionto the calculated capacity. Additionally, we consider a 20% protocol overhead in our calculations."</mark> Page 7
- <mark class="hltr-#ffd400">"Insteadof delineating specific antenna beams, a satelliteâ€™s visibility isdetermined solely based on the off-Zenith angle, providingterminal designers with the flexibility to optimize antennadesign within the bounds of a viable minimum elevationangle. This approach simplifies the design process, although aspecific radiation pattern mask can be applied if detailed beamcharacterization is necessary"</mark> Page 8
- <mark class="hltr-#ffd400">"For the purposes outlined in this paper,we have chosen to fix the user bandwidth and focus on opti-mizing the Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) selection."</mark> Page 9
