>Toying with the titles of a couple of 1950s classic sci-fi/horror movies, this issue’s “Mobile Radio” column reports recent testing initiatives aimed at providing 5G coverage from way above: In fact, from outside Earth’s atmosphere, delivered by satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO). Starlink, the satellite Internet constellation operated by SpaceX, Elon Musk’s company, has undoubtedly captured world’s headlines, but other initiatives are under way, also involving traditional operators, whose business was so far more ground based. These enterprises have a common goal: providing an umbrella, Gb/s-speed coverage to remote, rural areas where 5G access would still be years in the making while effectively addressing the 5G goals of billions of connected devices.
