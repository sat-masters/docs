For this scenario a single satellite orbiting in LEO below a megaconstellation placed in LEO is considered. 

## Latency

[According to SpaceX ](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/sxs-spacex.png) mentioned in the [[Communication Services project (CSP)]] poster. less than 100 ms to and from anywhere on earth. 


## Throughput 

Theoretically the same as a traditional downlink as, however as the satellite interacts with the mega constellation as a traditional user, the link would be shared between users. Therefore the throughput of the satellite depends on the amount of users simultaneous trying to connect using the constellaion. 

## Price 


## Resilience 
No dependency on one single groundstation, as these mega constellations has multiple.
