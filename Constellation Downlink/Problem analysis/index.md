title: Problem Analysis
---
This section seeks to find the core of the problem to be solved. 

To do this a list of specs for downlinks needs to be specified. 

This list includes but is not limited to: 
- Latency
- Throughput
- Price 
- Resilience 
- Convenience

First a traditional downlink is considered in: [[Specs of traditional downlink]]

Then an alternative downlink is considered in: [[Specs of new downlink]]
## Preliminary conclusions 
Some preliminary conclusions: 

### Latency
From the estimations made it can be seen that the new downlink theoretically has multiple advantages. The latency of the new downlink is in many cases much lower than that of the old downlink. 

### Throughput
The throughput of the new downlink is lower than the traditional downlink when the groundstation has line of sight with the satellite. But as the satellite spends most of it's time not over the groundstation the amount of data which can be downlinked per second
