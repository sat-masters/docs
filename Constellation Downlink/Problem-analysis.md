This section seeks to find the core of the problem to be solved. 

To do this a list of specs for downlinks needs to be specified. 

This list includes but is not limited to: 
- Latency
- Throughput
- Price 
- Resilience 
- Convenience

First a traditional downlink is considered in: [[Specs of traditional downlink]]

Then an alternative downlink is considered in: [[Specs of new downlink]]

An ongoing nasa project is also funding research in this area. This project is called [[Communication Services project (CSP)]]
