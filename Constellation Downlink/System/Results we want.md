#### Average throughput for the different solutions

#### Probability of buffer overflow for the different solutions 

#### Average time in qeueue for a packet for different solutions
#### How the alpha changes the performance of the different solutions 

#### How the relationship between T_a and T_delta changes the performance of the different solutions

#### Complexity of the different solutions? 
Maybe this can be found just analytically?

#### Maybe also try changing the T_w to see what of the algorithms are feasable over longer time periods? 
May just be included in the one above as we may also be able to see the complexity grow as the time dimension grows? 

#### How small should T_a be vs performance?
