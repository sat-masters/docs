#### Average throughput for the different solutions

#### Probability of buffer overflow for the different solutions 

#### Average time in qeueue for a packet for different solutions
#### How the alpha changes the performance of the different solutions 

#### How the relationship between T_a and T_delta changes the performance of the different solutions

#### Complexity of the different solutions? 
Maybe this can be found just analytically?

#### Maybe also try changing the T_w to see what of the algori
