### First come first served to completion: 
This policy takes the closest CS and connects to it and stays connected to it untill it is not possible to stay connected due to lack of visibility. 
This minimizes the amount of handovers (doesnt really?) compared to the minimum distanceminimum angle policy. 

### Minimum distance policy
The US always connects to the closest CS. This has the advantage of always  connecting to the CS with the best connection at the expence of more handovers.


The minimum distance and FCFS policies implemented can be seen in this figure:
