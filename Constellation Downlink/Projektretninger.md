Some notes for interesting things to research
- SpaceX can incorperate FSO for new downlink why cant we? 
- How FSO can contribute to continous access instead of intermittent as RF will give you.

Out there ideas: 
- Something like the new horizon telescope but using the starlink constellation for mars/moon communication?
