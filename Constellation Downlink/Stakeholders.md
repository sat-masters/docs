### Potential customers


- Weather missions.
	- Getting real time information about the weather will increase the performance of the weather models. 
- Emergency resoponder missions
	- For emergency responding (for example natural disaster responding) latency of information is paramount. 
- Military mission 
	- To get near realtime data of the battlefield is very important. 
- Hyperspectral imaging 
	- These missions create a large amount of data. Since the datalink is continous the amount of data that can be generated and downlinked can increase.
